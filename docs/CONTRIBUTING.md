# Contributing Guide

Thank you for taking the time to consider contributing to Pupu! This guide will help you understand how to effectively report issues, submit code, or propose documentation improvements.

## Before You Start

- **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue or pull request, please search the [issue list](https://github.com/ZhangXiChang/starlink/issues) to confirm if your idea has already been discussed.
- **Before Coding**: Whether you're fixing a bug you found or adding a new feature, **it is recommended to create an issue for discussion first**. This helps ensure your work aligns with the project's goals and avoids duplicate efforts. If you're addressing an existing issue, creating a new one may not be necessary.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pupu
    cd pupu
    ```
3.  **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch from the latest `main` branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b <branch-name>
    ```
4.  **Make Changes and Commit**: Implement your changes locally.
    - **Follow Code Style**: Please adhere to the existing code style and conventions in the project.
